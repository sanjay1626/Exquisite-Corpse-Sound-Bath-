# Exquisite-Corpse-Sound-Bath-

A music collaboration tool to facilitate the creative process and provide inspiration for your personal endeavors.
Users can record sounds that go into a pool of sound samples.
On the Record page "load samples" randomly selects 3 samples and returns them to a player.
All 3 samples are played together.

Future development

- players will have some controls to allow for mixing and enhancing the sample combination.
- If a user creates something they wish to keep they will have the ability to record and store the new mix they made.
- Users can control/manipulate audio and visuals

- samplers/ synths/ oscillators added
- Dedicated banks to organize similar sounds/samples.

- Mobile Implementation
- NFT generation (optional)
